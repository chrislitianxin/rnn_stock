Nevermind the fact it's a fantastic book, Jack has a really good way of interviewing and some of the questions he asks should serve as inspiration. I would not recommend asking him about his fuck ups in the first meeting though. Just try and be friendly, get to know him, what he did after high school, find out how he got interested etc. 18\n",

Good news is that I was definitely the best ER Associate when I worked and the offer that I was given is still up.
