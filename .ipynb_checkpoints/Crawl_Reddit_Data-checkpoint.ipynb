      "excellent easily understandable information. I just have one question: does Carol LN app handle routing by itself, or does it leverage LN nodes for this? 24\n",
      "That was an excellent read, easy to understand for the non-technical amongst us, and got me quite excited. \n",

      "Carol says, \"I'll show you\" then realizes she cant.\n",
      "\n",
      "She cant simply send Sue some LN coin, to onboard her. She needs to give Sue BTC, waiting for confirmation, then teach her all the steps to use LN app.\n",

      "I laughed, but it's also more than a meme, an alpaca sock company was the first to take BTC payments. 8\n",
      "There's something we call \"side car channels\" that address this initial onboarding use case. Basically, Carol can send money to Sue over Lightning with the end result being that Sue has an inbound channel to her. More or less, we use a node on the network to swap Carol's off-chain coins for on-chain coins to Sue (in the form of a channel). The node that helped with this onboarding maybe gets an additional bonus. \n",
      " 43\n",
      "No, if Sue has her bitcoind and lnd nodes already installed, Carol can open a channel to her node and send her a push amount which will be Sue's money. 10\n",

      "Sounds like you're describing a web wallet? It's possible these would arise (there's a toy version on https://htlc.me/), but this kind of defeats the purpose of the whole \"non-custodial\" thing we get by using payment channels. Just as there exist a gradient of wallets with tradeoffs w.r.t trust/custody/etc, a similar set of wallets may arise with Lightning. However, we're committed to maintaining the trust-minimization that Lightning allows within the applications/wallets we build+release.  14\n",

I know its probably not possible to get a good answer to this (like, what size LN are we talking about), but how much bandwidth will we be using to keep this up to date? Mobile plans and all - thats the reason I asked if Carols LN app leveraged other LN nodes (to calculate route to save bandwidth), maybe a node you run yourself at home, or your friend. 6\n",

      "Minimally, Carol's bandwidth usage is bounded by the number of channels that can be opened+closed each block. She doesn't need to get an update each time someone sends a payment on the network or anything like that. If Carol is a little more advanced, then she can connect her mobile app to a node she's running at home. This lets her also participate in routing, and receive payments passively to her node. In this case, her phone app is more or less just a frontend for her node. 15\n",

      "\n",
      "You should look into something called [*channel factories*](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/67158/what-are-channel-factories-and-how-do-they-work). They sit in between the blockchain and Lightning and allow for dynamic opening and closing of channels without the necessity of an on-chain transaction. 6\n",

      "\n",
      "In that case, the sender gets an encrypted error reply back with the current fee policy of that node/channel. In a sense, nodes that send payments relatively infrequently wouldn't need these dynamic updates. The downside is if your view of their policy is inconsistent, then you'd incur an extra cumulative round trip (that first failure), then you'd (potentially) retry with your new view of their policy.   8\n",

      "Yesterday we issued a couple temporary bans to accounts who were spreading fake news about a supposed SEC meeting, apparently in a widespread attempt to manipulate markets. Those accounts have been labeled and will be banned permanently if caught doing anything similar.  23\n",
